Have a growing collection of whiskey and can't keep track of what you have? Look no further!

LastDram helps you find those bottles that have been open for too long so you can finish them off before they lose their flavor. Simply add each bottle in your collection through LastDram and keep track of information such as the date you acquired it and the date you opened it!

COMING SOON

- Add friends on LastDram and view their entire collections!
- Notify your friends on LastDram when you crack open a bottle or finish a bottle, and vice versa!

If you have any issues, please raise a GitHub issue at https://github.com/danadajian/last-dram/issues.

Happy collecting!
